I took a random amount of letters in a rectangle format and implemented them into a two element array. 
Then, given a list of words, found where they exhisted in this rectangle of letters whether they went up, down, for-wards, or backwards.
The program takes a textfile called hidden.txt that has the dimensions of the rectangle at the top followed by letters spaced in an even rectangluar form, and under it has a list of words.
When it has finished running it then outputs the same list of words in a text file called found.txt with their position given by their row and then column. 
If a word does not exist it gives a row and column of 0 0.
